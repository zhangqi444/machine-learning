# Parameter play

## Instructions

There are a lot of parameters that are set by default when working with these classifiers. Intellisense in VS Code can help you dig into them. Adopt one of the ML Classification Techniques in this section and retrain models tweaking various parameter values. Build a notebook explaining why some changes help the model quality while others degrade it. Be detailed in your answer.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary                                                                                                              | Adequate                                              | Needs Improvement             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
|          | A notebook is presented with a classifier fully built up and its parameters tweaked and changes explained in textboxes | A notebook is partially presented or poorly explained | A notebook is buggy or flawed |
