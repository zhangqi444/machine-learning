# Try different clustering methods

## Instructions

In this section, you learned about K-Means clustering. Sometimes K-Means is not appropriate for your data. Create a notebook using data either from these sections or from somewhere else (credit your source) and show a different clustering method NOT using K-Means. What did you learn? 

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary                                                       | Adequate                                                             | Needs Improvement            |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|          | A notebook is presented with a well-documented clustering model | A notebook is presented without good documentation and/or incomplete | Incomplete work is submitted |
