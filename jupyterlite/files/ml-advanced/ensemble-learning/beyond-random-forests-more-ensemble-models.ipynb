    "Ensembles are the combination of different machine learning models, where by averaging the results of all models trained together on the same dataset, the result can be away good than any individual model. These types of models can be used for all kinds of tasks, including classification, regression and detecting anomalies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In his book *[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)*, *Aurelion Geron* gave a perfect analogy describing the ensemble learning: \"Suppose you pose a complex question to thousands of random people, then aggregate their answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than an expertâ€™s answer. This is called the *wisdom of the crowd*. Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of predictors is called an ensemble; thus, this technique is called Ensemble Learning, and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests that was used in the previous assignment is an example of ensemble models. It combined different decision trees. Usually, these types of models are classified into three groups that will be covered in this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Averaging Methods: Such as voting classifiers/regressors, bagging classifiers/regressors, random forests, extra trees classifier/regressor, etc...\n",
    "* Boosting Methods: Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost\n",
    "* Stacking in which instead of averaging the results of multiple models, multiple models are trained on the full training set and there is a final model trained on the different subsets (folds) of the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the above algorithms are implemented in Sklearn, except XGBoost and Stacking which is implemented indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like said in the beginning, these types of models can be used for both regression and classification, but this assignment will consider classification domain and for giving focus on the ensemble models, we will use the same dataset we used previouly, in random forests. "
