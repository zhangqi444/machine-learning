## Instructions

The <a href="../../assets/data/coca-cola-co.csv">Coca-Cola Co spreadsheet</a>{cite}`cocacola_excel` is missing some calculations. Your task is to:

1. Calculate the Gross profits of FY '15, '16, '17, and '18.
    - Gross Profit = Net Operating revenues - Cost of goods sold.
2. Calculate the average of all the gross profits. Try to do this with a function.
    - Average = Sum of gross profits divided by the number of fiscal years (10).
    - Documentation of the [AVERAGE function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/average-function-047bac88-d466-426c-a32b-8f33eb960cf6).
3. This is an csv file, but it should be editable in any spreadsheet platform.
