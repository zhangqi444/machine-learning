Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the future. Examples of namespaces are the set of built-in names (containing functions such as `abs()`, and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense, the set of attributes of an object also forms a namespace.\n",

    "By the way, we use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression `z.real`, `real` is an attribute of the object `z`. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression `modname.func_name`, `modname` is a module object and `func_name` is an attribute of it. In this case, there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace!\n",

Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other’s module names.\n",

In the simplest case, `__init__.py` can just be an empty file, but it can also execute the initialization code for the package or set the `__all__` variable, described later.\n",
