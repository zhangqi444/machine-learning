When it comes to doing data science with big data, the cloud can be a game changer. In the next three sections, we are going to see what the cloud is and why it can be very helpful. We are also going to explore a heart failure dataset and build a model to help assess the probability of someone having heart failure. We will use the power of the cloud to train, deploy and consume a model in two different ways. One way uses only the user interface in a Low code/No code fashion, and the other way uses the Azure Machine Learning Software Developer Kit (Azure ML SDK).
